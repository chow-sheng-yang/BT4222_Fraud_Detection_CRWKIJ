# BT4222 Fraud Detection Group 4
## Overview
This project aims to add improvement to a Kaggle fraud detection classification [competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data) 
The following improvements include: 
* Introducing Weighted Ensemble Learning (Stacking) with 3 models: XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost
* Utilising SMOTE to balance the target class and evaluate the impact
* Conduct KPrototype clustering on fraud users to get a deeper understanding on fraud users
* Train an AutoEncoder model to detect anomalies

## Getting Started
1. Due to the size of the datasets, we have placed the datasets in a google drive [folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nhZ_i67kfcwn4ka1rVK6l1CrpLpoZ1pX?usp=sharing)
2. Once the datasets have been downloaded, use those datasets and run the notebook **1. Preprocessing - Removing Missing Values** to obtain a new preprocessed dataset.
3. After that, the notebooks can be run in any preferred order based on your viewing preferences.
